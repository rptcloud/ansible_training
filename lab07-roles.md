# Lab 7: Roles

In our last lab, we successfully completed our first Ansible playbooks.  This will be the foundation that we build the rest of our labs off of.  

In this lab, we will begin to variablize our code in order to make it more robust and re-usable.  We are going to start the lab off by variablizing some of the common command line options that we've been running, and then move into refactoring parts of our existing playbook to leverage variables.

Duration: 30-40 minutes

- Task 1: Create a new ansible.cfg in our run directory to store common run arguments
- Task 2: Create group level variables for host groups and test
- Task 3: Create host level variables for individual hosts and test
- Task 4: Create playbook variables and test
- Task 5: Use `--extra-vars` to supercede all other variables
